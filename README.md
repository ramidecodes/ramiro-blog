### Based on NextJS Notion Starter Kit

[![Build Status](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Prettier Code Formatting](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-brightgreen.svg)](https://prettier.io)

## Intro

This repo is what I use to power my personal blog and portfolio site [ramidecodes.com](https://ramidecodes.com).

It uses Notion as a CMS, [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Features

- Setup only takes a few minutes ([single config file](./site.config.ts)) 💪
- Robust support for Notion content via [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x)
- Built using Next.js, TS, and React
- Excellent page speeds
- Smooth image previews
- Automatic social images
- Automatic pretty URLs
- Automatic table of contents
- Full support for dark mode
- Quick search via CMD+K / CMD+P
- Responsive for different devices
- Optimized for Next.js and Vercel

## Demos

- [Default demo](https://nextjs-notion-starter-kit.transitivebullsh.it)
- [My site](https://ramidecodes.com) - Deployed from the `main` branch

## Setup

**All config is defined in [site.config.ts](./site.config.ts).**

This project requires a recent version of Node.js (we recommend >= 16).

1. Fork / clone this repo
2. Change a few values in [site.config.ts](./site.config.ts)
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev` to test locally
5. `npm run deploy` to deploy to vercel 💪

I tried to make configuration as easy as possible — All you really need to do to get started is edit `rootNotionPageId`.

We recommend duplicating the [default page](https://notion.so/7875426197cf461698809def95960ebf) as a starting point, but you can use any public notion page you want.

Make sure your root Notion page is **public** and then copy the link to your clipboard. Extract the last part of the URL that looks like `7875426197cf461698809def95960ebf`, which is your page's Notion ID.

In order to find your Notion workspace ID (optional), just load any of your site's pages into your browser and open up the developer console. There will be a global variable that you can access called `block` which is the Notion data for the current page. If you enter `block.space_id`, it will print out your page's workspace ID.

I recommend setting up a collection on your home page that contains all of your articles / projects / content. There are no structural constraints on your Notion workspace, however, so feel free to add content as you normally would in Notion.

## URL Paths

The app defaults to slightly different URL paths in dev vs prod (though pasting any dev pathname into prod will work and vice-versa).

In development, it will use `/nextjs-notion-blog-d1b5dcf8b9ff425b8aef5ce6f0730202` which is a slugified version of the page's title suffixed with its Notion ID. I've found that it's really useful to always have the Notion Page ID front and center during local development.

In production, it will use `/nextjs-notion-blog` which is a bit nicer as it gets rid of the extra ID clutter.

The mapping of Notion ID to slugified page titles is done automatically as part of the build process. Just keep in mind that if you plan on changing page titles over time, you probably want to make sure old links will still work, and we don't currently provide a solution for detecting old links aside from Next.js's built-in [support for redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects).

See [mapPageUrl](./lib/map-page-url.ts) and [getCanonicalPageId](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/blob/master/packages/notion-utils/src/get-canonical-page-id.ts) for more details.

You can override the default slug generation on a per-page basis by adding a `Slug` text property to your database. Any page which has a `Slug` property will use that as its slug.

NOTE: if you have multiple pages in your workspace with the same slugified name, the app will throw an error letting you know that there are duplicate URL pathnames.

## Preview Images

  <img alt="Example preview image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/552829/160142320-35343317-aa9e-4710-bcf7-67e5cdec586d.gif" width="458">
</p>

We use [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) to serve images efficiently, with preview images optionally generated via [lqip-modern](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/lqip-modern). This gives us extremely optimized image support for sexy smooth images.

Preview images are **enabled by default**, but they can be slow to generate, so if you want to disable them, set `isPreviewImageSupportEnabled` to `false` in `site.config.ts`.

### Redis

If you want to cache generated preview images to speed up subsequent builds, you'll need to first set up an external [Redis](https://redis.io) data store. To enable redis caching, set `isRedisEnabled` to `true` in `site.config.ts` and then set `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variables to point to your redis instance.

You can do this locally by adding a `.env` file:

```bash
REDIS_HOST='TODO'
REDIS_PASSWORD='TODO'
```

If you're not sure which Redis provider to use, we recommend [Redis Labs](https://redis.com), which provides a free plan.

Note that preview images and redis caching are both optional features. If you’d rather not deal with them, just disable them in your site config.

## Styles

All CSS styles that customize Notion content are located in [styles/notion.css](./styles/notion.css). They mainly target global CSS classes exported by react-notion-x [styles.css](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/blob/master/packages/react-notion-x/src/styles.css).

Every notion block gets its own unique classname, so you can target individual blocks like this:

```css
.notion-block-260baa77f1e1428b97fb14ac99c7c385 {
  display: none;
}
```

## Automatic Social Images

All Open Graph and social meta tags are generated from your Notion content, which makes social sharing look professional by default.

Social images are generated automatically using [Vercel OG Image Generation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation). You can tweak the default React template for social images by editing [api/social-images.tsx](./pages/api/social-image.tsx).

You can view an example social image live in production [here](https://transitivebullsh.it/api/social-image?id=dfc7f709-ae3e-42c6-9292-f6543d5586f0).

## Environment Variables

If you're using Redis, analytics, or any other feature which requires environment variables, then you'll need to [add them to your Vercel project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

If you want to test your redis builds with GitHub Actions, then you'll need to edit the [default build action](./.github/workflows/build.yml) to add `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PASSWORD`. Here is an [example from my personal branch](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit/blob/transitive-bullshit/.github/workflows/build.yml#L17-L21). You'll also need to add these environment variables to your GitHub repo as [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
